Hello World :)

Here, I will be deconstructing the Google Homepage and rebuilding it. This project is meant to consolidate and showcase what I have learned so far in HTML/CSS based on The Odin Project's curriculum. 

Exciting features I will be showcasing:
    - CSS Flexbox! This will allow me to build a responsive web design that adapts to varying viewport sizes. 
    - I thought it would be interesting to link the easy version to the difficult version through user input into the search bar and hit "enter".
    - Something new that isn't part of the curriculum, but I thought would be an interesting challenge: to learn to build a toggle button and a pop-up menu.

Note that as this is more of a "proof-of-concept" project, most links won't lead anywhere.

Lesson learned:
    - Coding is fun!
    - Books are great, but you don't really know anything until you put it into practice.
    - Keep learning!

Have I mentioned how amazing The Odin Project is?

Happy coding!
